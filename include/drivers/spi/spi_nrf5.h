 * Device configuration
 *
 * Device-independent configuration:
 * Bits [0 : 11] in the config parameter of the spi_configure() API are defined
 * with the following fields.
 *
 * SCK polarity     [ 0 ]       - SCK inactive state (0 = low, 1 = high)
 * SCK phase        [ 1 ]       - Data captured/changed on which SCK edge:
 *                              -   0 = leading/following edges, respectively
 *                              -   1 = following/leading edges, respectively
 * loop_mode        [ 2 ]       - Not used/Unsupported
 * transfer_mode    [ 3 ]       - First significant bit (0 = MSB, 1 = LSB)
 * word_size        [ 4 : 7 ]   - Size of a data train in bits
 * unused           [ 8 : 11 ]  - Unused word_size field bits
 *
 * Device-specific configuration:
 * Bits [12 : 31] in the config parameter of the spi_configure() API are
 * available, with the following fields defined for this device.
 *
 * Operational Mode [ 12 ]      - Master (0), Slave (1)
