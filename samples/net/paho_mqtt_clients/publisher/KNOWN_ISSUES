Issues and Limitations
----------------------

- Unable to connect
	Caused by:
		Incorrect TCP flags handling from the Zephyr IP Stack.
	Workaround:
		Reset the board.

- Publish error
- Subscribe error
        Caused by:
		The MQTT broker is sending another MQTT message while the
		client is still processing the QoS handshake from a
		previous MQTT message. MQTT QoS in Zephyr is implemented
		in a synchronous way. For asynchronous implementations, see:
		http://git.eclipse.org/c/mosquitto/org.eclipse.mosquitto.git/tree/
	Workaround 1:
		Reduce the speed/amount of messages received by the
		application.
	Workaroung 2:
		Use the mqtt_read function to handle all the incoming
		messages.

- RX or TX error
	Caused by:
		Perhaps the rx/tx timeouts are too short for the LAN.
        Workaround:
		Increase the rx or tx timeout.
		See: publisher/src/netz.c, struct netz_ctx_t.
