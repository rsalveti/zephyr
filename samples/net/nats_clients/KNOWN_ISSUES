Issues
------

- Unable to connect
	Caused by:
		Incorrect TCP flags handling from the Zephyr IP Stack.
	Workaround:
		Reset the board.

- Publisher or Subscriber error
	Caused by:
		The NATS server will send the PING message at configurable
		intervals. If the PING message is not handled by the
		client, the server will close the connection.

		The NATS applications are synchronous, so if the PING
		message arrives when the application is processing
		another message (i.e. verbose = 1), the PING message
		will be ignored and the server will close the connection.
	Workaround:
		Codify a routine similar to handle_msg (see main.c) to
		handle all the incoming messages.

- RX or TX error
	Caused by:
		Perhaps the rx/tx timeouts are too short for the LAN.
        Workaround:
		Increase the rx or tx timeout.
		See: publisher/src/netz.c, struct netz_ctx_t.
