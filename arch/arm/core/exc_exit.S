/**
 *
 * @brief Kernel housekeeping when exiting interrupt handler installed
 *            directly in vector table
 *
 * Kernel allows installing interrupt handlers (ISRs) directly into the vector
 * table to get the lowest interrupt latency possible. This allows the ISR to be
 * invoked directly without going through a software interrupt table. However,
 * upon exiting the ISR, some kernel work must still be performed, namely
 * possible context switching. While ISRs connected in the software interrupt
 * table do this automatically via a wrapper, ISRs connected directly in the
 * vector table must invoke _IntExit() as the *very last* action before
 * returning.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 * void myISR(void)
 *     {
 *     printk("in %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
 *     doStuff();
 *     _IntExit();
 *     }
 *
 * @return N/A
