Drivers and Sensors
*******************

* KW40Z IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver support added

Networking
**********

* LWM2M support added
* net-app API support added. This is higher level API that can be used
  by applications to create client/server applications with transparent
  TLS (for TCP) or DTLS (for UDP) support.
* MQTT TLS support added
* Add support to automatically setup IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth IPSP networks
* TCP receive window support added
* Network sample application configuration file unification, where most of the
  similar configuration files were merged together
* Added Bluetooth support to HTTP(S) server sample application
* BSD socket layer fixes and enhancements
* Networking API documentation fixes
* Network shell enhancements
* Trickle algorithm fixes
* CoAP API fixes
* IPv6 fixes
* RPL fixes

Bluetooth
*********

* Bluetooth Mesh support (all mandatory features and most optional ones)
* GATT Service Changed Characteristic support
* IPSP net-app support: a simplified networking API reducing duplication
  of common tasks an application writer has to go through to connect
  to the network.
* BLE controller qualification-ready, with all required tests passing
* Controller-based privacy (including all optional features)
* Extended Scanner Filter Policies support in the controller
* Controller roles (Advertiser, Scanner, Master and Slave) separation in
  source code, conditionally includable
* Flash access cooperation with BLE radio activity
